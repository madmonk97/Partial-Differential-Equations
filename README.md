# Partial-Differential-Equations

This course was focused on deriving partial differential equations relevant to scientific and engineering applications and discuss the methods for their solutions. 
 In this course I had the opportunity to learn how to compute and plot partial differential equations using MATLAB and focus on:
- Derivation of partial differential equations in engineering   
- Solution of elementary linear partial differential equations 
- Analysis of partial differential equations in engineering applications
